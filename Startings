Start the code with a welcome message introducing the shop.
Then give the user 2 options: "Admin" and "Shop"
If Admin, make a section where a password is needed. (optional fail limit).
If successfully types out password, then open the shopping menu. (should be nothing there because there is no items).
Then the user can choose to exit. (loop)
If the user chooses Shop, then open 3 or more options for the user to shop. Like sports, clothings, and books.
